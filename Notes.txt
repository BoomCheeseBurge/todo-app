To check if there is any existing todos in the browser's local storage, either run the command 'localstorage' on the browser console OR

    - Open up the developer tools menu in the browser
    - Go to the 'Application' (Chrome) or 'Storage' (Firefox) section
    - Click on 'Local Storage' to see the saved todos

Finding the todo index from the unfiltered or original todos like the one shown in the 'TodoList.jsx' file has it's limitations. 

In later courses we learn a more sophisticated way of doing it (the limitation is that the code might misbehave if you have two todos with the exact same text :) See if you can figure out why!

My answer: cause key conflicts.

My solution: prevent the same todo input to be added twice when about to add a new todo and console log a message about it (though, this is not the best solution).
